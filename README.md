üöÄ Astro Storefront Case Study
==============================

This project is a **case study implementation** of a modern e-commerce storefront built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Shopify‚Äôs Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront).

It demonstrates architectural patterns and components I developed while contributing to a client project (Dec 2023 ‚Äì Feb 2024).
For this public case study, all **client branding, proprietary assets, and third-party contributions have been removed or replaced** with neutral placeholders. The result is a clean, MIT-licensed codebase that highlights my own authored work.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robinsr/astro-storefront-case-study
cd astro-storefront-case-study
pnpm install
```

### Run in mock mode (default)

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If you want to connect to a real Shopify store, set environment variables in .env:

```
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=shpat_XXXX
```
